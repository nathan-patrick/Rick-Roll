What is this Hack?

This hack in simple is creating a disguised shortcut that looks like a browser icon, but secretly is a script that 
opens 100 individual tabs to Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up. The hope is that the script 
crashes the target's computer, but if not, they will have to suffer with closing 100 individual tabs of Rick Roll.

The ideal situation is if someone leaves and forgets to lock their computer. Since this Hack does not take too
long to set up, it's perfect for a friend who left really quick to use the restroom or something. 


How to Use:

Download the "Rick Roll Spam Hack"

Drag the folder to a location that would not be commonly used by the user, for example "C:\Program Files (x86)"

Double click on the "Test Hack" file in the folder to test if the prank will work 

If it opens 3 or so tabs to the YouTube Page of Rick Roll, the real prank should work

RIGHT CLICK on the "Rick Roll Hack" and click "Show More Options" at the bottom of the menu

Then click on "Create Shortcut" and drag the created shortcut onto the desktop

RIGHT CLICK on the shortcut you dragged onto the desktop and click "Properties"

In the settings near the bottom, click "Change Icon"

Click the "Browse" button and find the folder you hid earlier, and open the "Browser Fake Icons" Folder

Double click on whichever icon the target uses as their normal browser

Click OK and OK again

Rename the hack shortcut to whichever browser icon you chose

Replace the target's normal browser icon with the fake one you just created

Now leave it up to the target to open their 'browser' for a big surprise!
